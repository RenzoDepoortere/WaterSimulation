This project is an attemped combination of a wave propagation system and a fluid simulation system inside of Unreal Engine.
I used Unreal's built-in Shallow Water Simulation as wave propagation and Unreal's FLIP System as fluid simulation system.

This project is based on the following paper: http://computationalsciences.org/publications/huang-2021-vast-ocean.html
